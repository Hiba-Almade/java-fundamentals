## Composition and Inheritance

* Create a class to represent a Restaurant. Each Restaurant should have a name, a number of stars and a price category.

Implement a Restaurant **constructor** and **toString** method.

* Create a class to represent a Review. Each Review should have a body, an author, and a number of stars.
 
  `>` Implement a Review **constructor** and **toString** method.

* Add an instance method **addReview** to your Restaurant class. This method should take in a Review instance, and associate that review with this Restaurant.


When you associate a review with a restaurant, that restaurantâ€™s star rating should change.
